## Successfully introduce cosmetics in your server

{% hint style="info" %}
1. You must not make them easy to obtain. Make them a rare perk for donors or special events prizes (example: seasonal quests, boss battle prizes, staff members exclusive, donors exclusive)
2. Always make sure to publish a new cosmetic when you are 100% sure you want to keep it forever in your server. People don't like to buy cosmetics and see them removed after some time.
3. Make unique cosmetics, don't make useless variations of the same cosmetic design.
